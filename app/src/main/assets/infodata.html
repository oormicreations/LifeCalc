            </p>
            <p>This calculator computes the time one spends on daily activities.
                The <i>Available time per day</i> number is the time you are left with at the end of a
                day to pursue your personal goals.
            </p>

            <p><i>The Time available in remaining life</i> is the number of years left in your
                life to achieve those goals, after deducting all the time that you will spend
                in other activities for the remaining of your life. The remaining life time
                is the difference of an optimistic effective total life time (90 years) and
                current age.
            </p>
            <p>The total available time is for your goals only, no sleep, no food,
                and no other activities whatsoever. Note that you may retire from work/job
                after 60, so you should enter an average value for work hours if you
                are younger than 60.
            </p>

            <p>The point is to estimate how much of our precious life is wasted in mere
                survival, and how insignificant is the amount of time we devote for
                higher purposes, such as Spiritual Practices.
                Ideally, a seeker tries to reverse the situation.
            </p>
